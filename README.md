# About this project
This is a program for my senior thesis. 
It consists of building a model that can discriminate between a real and a spoofed face. However without the necessity of the user giving any spoofed images to the training part of the model. For that, a GAN (Generative Adversary Network) that does style transfer will be used to the artificial creation of the spoofed images, using only real faces one, and just one for the creation of the desired style. The network used to create the poofed images is  [Fast Style Transfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer).
